			<p class="context"> <img class="image" src="tripple.knot.png"> In a digital context, socially relevant implications refer to the consequences or outcomes of digital technologies, platforms, and practices on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. This includes considerations of how digital technologies and platforms shape social interactions, relationships, and communication, as well as how they impact social institutions, power dynamics, and cultural norms. For example, Twitter's implementation of the "mute" feature allows users to hide tweets and notifications from accounts they do not wish to interact with, giving users more control over their social media experience and reducing the impact of online harassment. In contrast, Facebook's algorithm that prioritizes content from friends and family over the news or public posts can lead to filter bubbles, where users are only exposed to a narrow range of opinions and perspectives, contributing to polarization and misinformation.
